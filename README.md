# opioid_hackathon

## Whats working:

- Gets all necessary information for doctors
- Gets doctors in ascending order by distance from current location
- Can specify distance from location
- Can specify preferred gender for practitioner

## Whats not working:

- Cannot find sufficient MAT data for practitioners
- Was not able to implement language selection due to time constraints
- API does not work well for cities; can only really work for latitude and longitude, so need to convert city to lat/long
- Not necessarily FHIR protocol, but more of a proof of concept that these things can be done

## To do:

- Add appointments with FHIR
- integrate with front end
